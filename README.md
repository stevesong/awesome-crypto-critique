He earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Berkeley in 2003 and joined ICSI to study network security and measurement. "The entire cryptocurrency and blockchain ecology is rife with frauds, criminalities, and tulip-mania style hype and needs to be properly disposed of into the ashes of history. A ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is just a horribly inefficient append-only file which costs a literal fortune to secure without actually providing meaningful distributed trust, while cryptocurrencies are provably inferior than actual currencies for legal real world transactions. Beyond the sheer uselessness have emerged a whole host of bad ideas, ranging from the ‚Äúput a bird^H^H^H^H blockchain on it‚Äù hype to unregistered (and mostly fraudulent) securities with ‚ÄúInitial Coin Offerings‚Äù to an invitation for massive theft in the form of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contracts."
* [Ross Anderson et al: Bitcoin Redux: crypto crime, and how to tackle it](https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/06/01/bitcoin-redux-crypto-crime-and-how-to-tackle-it/) ([full paper](https://weis2018.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/05/WEIS_2018_paper_38.pdf))- 2018-06-01 - Anderson is a Professor of Security Engineering at the University Cambridge. Bitcoin Redux explains what‚Äôs going wrong in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a "balance" and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they‚Äôre both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters. We‚Äôve been looking at the details.
  * [Ross Anderson: Why Bitcoin is Not Cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9HH_dFcoLc) - 2018-04-10 - üì∫ walks through why bitcoin is not cash and the complex legal questions it would need to deal with if it wanted to be.

* [Simon Wardley: A Spoiler for the Future of Bitcoin](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2013/11/a-spoiler-for-future-bitcoin.html) - 2013-11-27 - "As you can guess, I'm not a fan of bitcoin. If left unchecked then I find it has the potential to undermine the importance of Government which is actually not good for competition and not good for the market. I hope none of the above happens and would rather see bitcoin disappear in a puff of history." (NB: he predicts massive appreciation in bitcoin and is concerned how it can undermine government and tax revenue.)

A Ponzi scheme is a zero-sum enterprise. But bitcoin is a negative-sum phenomenon that you can‚Äôt even pursue a claim against, argues Robert McCauley.

  > Once upon a time in Albania, a scrappy, alternative finance industry emerged to take on and eventually supplant a sclerotic, technologically-backward banking system. The lessons from its dramatic collapse remain relevant today.¬†
  >
  > Essentially, what was initially touted as a post-communist entrepreneurial success story proved to be pyramid schemes of breathtaking proportions. Slick marketing and lofty promises turned an informal, decentralised, crime-facilitating ecosystem into a mainstream mania that sucked in multitudes of people, unchecked by feeble and fitful regulatory warnings.

### DAOs

* [Is The DAO going to be DOA?](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@dan/is-the-dao-going-to-be-doa) - 2016-05-16 - by Dan Larimer (founder of BitShares and much else). Larimer sets out most of the basic critiques of DAOs as governance innovation extremely well:
  > Fancy technology can obscure our assessment of what is really going on. The DAO solves a single problem: the corrupt trustee or administrator. It replaces voluntary compliance with a corporation‚Äôs charter under threat of lawsuit, with automated compliance with software defined rules. This subtle change may be enough to bypass regulatory hurdles facing traditional trustee‚Äôs and administrators, but it doesn‚Äôt solve most of the problems the regulations were attempting to address.
  >
  > What The DAO doesn‚Äôt solve is all of the other problems inherent with any joint venture. These are people problems, economic problems, and political problems. In some sense, The DAO creates many new problems caused by its ridged rules and expensive machine-enforced process for change.
  >
  > The DAO doesn‚Äôt solve the ‚Äúgroup trap‚Äù where by losers subsidize winners. It disempowers the individual actor and forces him to submit to group decision making. It doesn‚Äôt make raising money cheaper for companies, it just adds blockchain-enforced bureaucratic and political processes.

## Iron-manning the pro arguments

Here we collect the best theses for why this is important/interesting/world-changing.

### Bitcoin

* [Bitcoin for the Open-Minded Skeptic](https://www.matthuang.com/bitcoin_for_the_open_minded_skeptic) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]. Note: more an argument for why Bitcoin will "make it" than any argument why that is socially valuable (or not).
* [7 Things To Read About Bitcoin (For Institutional Investors)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/05/7-things-to-read-about-bitcoin-for-institutional-investors/) - May 2020 - by [[people/Matt Huang]]

### General

* [JumpCrypto Crypto Reading List (on Github)](https://github.com/JumpCrypto/crypto-reading-list)

### Web3

* [Sean Bonner: Why Web3](https://blog.seanbonner.com/2021/10/26/why-web3/) - 2021-10-26 - by Sean Bonner. "Web3 upends the power structures we‚Äôve grown accustomed to and puts artists and creators back into the drivers seat. ,,, Web3 offers a future where people are in charge of their own identities, not beholden to the whims of data hoarding corporations. People control their own accounts, own their own futures. ... So if you are asking ‚ÄúWhy Web3?‚Äù The answer is simple. Web3 is the future."

### Fat protocols

From https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/

> The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of ‚Äúthin‚Äù protocols and ‚Äúfat‚Äù applications.
>
> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It‚Äôs a stack with ‚Äúfat‚Äù protocols and ‚Äúthin‚Äù applications.
